# US Droughts Data

Dry and wet cycles are dependent on a number of factors including geography, topology and climate drivers. Drought phases in the US can be explained by changes in the track of extratropical cyclones, which can occur during climate cycles such as the El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, as well as the North Atlantic Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. The country's contiguous western and especially southwestern region has experienced widespread drought since about year 2000 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droughts_in_the_United_States).

**Data**

2001-2021 US droughts data are collected by the [US Drought Monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataDownload.aspx). 

> The U.S. Drought Monitor is jointly produced by the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Map courtesy of NDMC.
