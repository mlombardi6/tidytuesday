**Anatomy of a discus thrower medalist**

Discus medalists similarly to shot put and hammer throwers have an impressive muscle and body structure among track and field athletes. The average height/weight for discus throw medalists between Barcelona 1992 and Rio de Janeiro 2016 was 1.98mt/123kg. On the other end, marathon athletes who require entirely different body attributes for long distance endurance averaged 1.70mt/58kg.

\ 

```{r}
dt_plot<- dt_olympics[season=="Summer" & 
            !is.na(medal) &
            year >= 1992 &
            sex=="M" &
            sport =="Athletics" & 
            discipline %in% c("Marathon",
                              "200 metres",
                              "High Jump",
                              "Discus Throw", 
                              "Javelin Throw", 
                              "Hammer Throw") & 
            !is.na(weight) & 
            !is.na(height) ] 

dt_plot %>%
  ggplot(aes(height, weight, col=discipline)) +
  geom_point(size=0.2, show.legend = F) +
  geom_mark_hull(aes(col= discipline, fill= discipline, label = discipline),
                 show.legend = F, expand = unit(3, "mm")) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16) + 
  labs(x="Height", y="Weight", 
       title= "Olympic medalists 1992-2016, Men",

# 2020 champion 

The new olympic champion from yesterday is [Daniel StÃ¥hl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_St%C3%A5hl) who won the gold medal for Sweden with a throw of 68.90 metres. The Swedish champion is an impressive 2 meters tall and 155kg athlete. He never looked in trouble for the final win, and finished off by shouting "I'm a Swedish Viking!" in his victory lap.

# Evolution of discus throwers

Discus throw is one of the few modern disciplines who were part of the ancient [Olympic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Olympic_Games) and [Panhellenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panhellenic_Games) games. Back then the anatomy of a discus thrower might have looked like the famous [Discobolus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discobolus). The first modern Olympic champion in 1986 was [Robert Garrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Garrett) with 1.88mt and 81kg. By 1948 discus throw medalists passed in average the 100kg mark and continue the upward trend until recent times.

```{r discus_time}
dt_olympics[season=="Summer" & 
            !is.na(medal) &
            sex=="M" &

            !is.na(weight) & 
            !is.na(height) , 
            .(medalists= .N, 
              avg_height= round(mean(height),2), 
              avg_weight= round(mean(weight),2)), year][order(-year)] %>%

  plot_ly(x=~ year, 
          y=~ avg_weight,
